        If it wasn’t for CUNY, Néo-Manhattan wouldn’t have happened. All three
        of the founders met at Baruch College and brainstormed ideas at
        McDonald’s on E 23rd street. That was the fall of 2019. One graduated,
        one dropped out and one is currently attending there as of 2021.

        The collection was inspired by "TAKE IVY" and Kensuke Ishizu. More
        specifically, Kensuke's fantasy of American students dressing in preppy
        fashion being shattered. Because you know, these Chads wore flip flops
        instead of penny loafers and were not "preppy" at all. Ultimately,
        Kensuke was able to persuade the Japanese public to believe the preppy
        look is real and authentic.

        The CUNY's student body represents the "real" New York. There is nothing
        more New York than squeezing in a part-time shift between classes. Ths
        shit is not glamorous. Everyone hustles and a bit insecure. Maybe that
        was just me.

        We understand there is no CUNY style but the attitude and lifestyle
        exist. CUNY is probably doing their best promoting the school system and
        the students but we personally didn't find that effective. The "bang for
        your buck" education makes CUNY special, not the students. This is our
        attempt to give the CUNY students representation and make them feel
        special.
