        Earlier this year, I was watching the show ‘High Fidelity’ on Hulu. In the first episode, Zoë Kravitz puts on a stained t-shirt. It was definitely her that made the stained white t-shirt look cool but the look resonated with me, and I wanted to recreate it with my team.

        I’m a huge fan of raw denim and in the denim community, stains and your personal creases are embraced rather than looked frowned upon. It's embraced because of the fade you get after wearing for years but also, you are prioritizing the work/action over the “freshness” of the garment. It's a sign of patience and stoicism.

        I wanted that “denim spirit” in a white T-Shirt. People try their absolute best to keep anything white clean. It’s almost a taboo getting them stained and leaving it. I wanted to challenge that perception.

        Unfortunately a cotton t-shirt does not age well like denim and to match the color, we decided to use coffee to hand stain the shirts. Also, coffee is a beverage that is associated with work.

        There were a couple of prints we were thinking about doing but ultimately we went with the phrase “Calm down it’s just Coffee.” on the back. When someone points out the stain just stand up and turn around to show them the message.

        I don’t want you to baby our clothes. Put them through work. My intention with this drop was to bring that vintage workwear and faded denim spirit to a t-shirt. Never let a garment limit your actions.
